/*
Mostly borrowed css and a bit made by Deniability

Imports from Netux(iloveyou):
- tons of shit
- small video with header buttons moved
- NB3 vote icons,
- recognizable room BOTs in chat(yeah like ima do that)
- a pack of animations
- an improvement on the lobby, the browser and the room edit room
- netux's fixes (including mobile view)
- Heebee's Rainbow progress bar.
- Ads on the header instead that on top of the video.
